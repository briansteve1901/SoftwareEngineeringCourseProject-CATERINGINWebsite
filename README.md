My friends and I created this project to fulfill Software Engineering Course Project at my university. 
CATERINGIN Website is a catering service website. We made a website where customers determine for themselves 
and order a catering menu for five days. After ordering, catering will be delivered directly to the customer for five days. 
This project applies Software Engineering Principles and uses AGILE for the Software Development Life Cycle Model. 
In the beginning, we have little knowledge about Back-End. However, we learned to code the Back-End of the website from YouTube. 
Glad to know that we have successfully created this website and scored 85 out of 100 for this project.
